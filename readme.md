# 🧠 AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis & Assistance System

This project provides an end-to-end AI-based  communicational healthcare assistant to predict diseases, suggest medicines (including Ayurveda and home remedies), and even facilitate emergency transport and video consultation. The aim is to offer an affordable, accessible, and semi-automated diagnostic tool, especially useful in rural and underserved areas.

## 🗂️ Workflow Overview

Below is a summarized explanation of the flow chart represented in the system:

1. **Patient Input**:
   - A user (patient) provides either:
     - Symptoms indicating a *seasonal disease*.
     - Multiple symptoms indicating a *multi-symptom disease*.
     - Their thoughts/feelings about the illness.

2. **AI & ML Processing**:
   - A **Machine Learning model** detects *seasonal diseases* and outputs Ayurvedic Medicines, Exercises, and Home Remedies.
   - For *multi-symptom* or complex cases, the system uses an **AI Model** to predict the likely disease using patient inputs and emotional data.

3. **Prediction Verification**:
   - The **Predicted Disease** is verified by:
     - A **Final Year Medical Student**, who suggests appropriate medicine.
     - The process is then double-verified by a **Certified Doctor**, validating patient thoughts, predicted illness, and suggested medication.

4. **User Assistance & Integration**:
   - Medicines are displayed to the patient.
   - Integration with:
     - **Pharmacy App** to order medicines.
     - **Ola App** for emergency transport.
     - **Video Call Appointment** system if further consultation is required.

## 🚀 Future Scope as a Business Model

This system can evolve into a **scalable health-tech startup** serving the following sectors:

1. Rural & Remote Areas: Where doctor availability is limited, AI and final-year med students bridge the gap.

2. Low-cost Healthcare services

3.  Subscription-based Health Service
4. Subscription for doctor promotion based on  (premium profile) + (patient review)
5. Subscription for patient 
6. income from affiliated pharmacy stores
